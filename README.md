# ARC³ Case Framework — Release v3

This bundle supersedes older templates. It includes:
- **Release Template (Obsidian/MD)** with STAR + Executive Summary, A/R/C, strict **A.4 → C.1** mapping, validity checklist, and continuation block.
- **Public Template (MD + RTF)** for Word/Docs/Pages.
- **Profiles:** Industry view (Impact-forward) and Academic view (Validity-forward).

**Export rule:** For academic PDFs, retitle Executive Summary → **Abstract** and remove the decision sentence; the decision remains in **C.3**.

**Acknowledgments:** STAR overview inspired by the STAR interview technique, commonly attributed to DDI’s Targeted Selection (1970s). No affiliation implied. [1][2]
