# ARC¬≥ Case Framework ‚Äî Release Template

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è ARC¬≥ Case Framework ‚Äî Release Template
**Mode badge:** `Mode: Standard | Qual | Lite`
**Selection rule:** Choose the mode by the **strongest available evidence**. If tied, use **Standard**.
### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Framework guardrails- **A.4 ‚Üí C.1 contract:** every criterion defined in **A.4** reappears as one row in **C.1** (no orphan metrics).- **Status vocabulary:** Quant (Standard/Lite): `Pass | Partial | Fail`; Qual (Qual): `Supported | Mixed | Not Supported | Emergent`- **Reliability targets:** Œ∫/Œ± ‚â• **0.70** where applicable (report actual).- **Conventions:** SI units; ISO-8601 dates; data sources as `system_log:<table>/<field>` or `instrument:<tool>@<version>`.

## ‚≠ê STAR Summary Card (Dual-Lane) ‚Äî one screen
### üß© One-liner
What it is, for whom, core purpose.**S ‚Äî Situation** ‚Äî one-line context & stakes.
**T ‚Äî Target (from A.4)** ‚Äî 3‚Äì5 criteria, each with an OWNER and DATA SOURCE.
**A ‚Äî Approach** ‚Äî methods + system + design type (between/within; randomized/counterbalanced), sample frame & recruitment, constraints, instruments/logs.
**R ‚Äî Results (dual-lane)**
- Impact (industry): ROI/adoption/efficiency/risk deltas (before ‚Üí after).
- Evidence (academic): observed vs target, effect sizes (d/Œ¥/OR/RR), CI/SE, assumptions (or nonparametric), ablations/sensitivity checks.

## Executive Summary (150‚Äì300 words)
Interpret STAR for a general reader. No new metrics. Mention the single most decision-relevant ablation.
For academic export, retitle to **Abstract** and drop the decision sentence.

## A ‚Äî Anchor & Aim
### üìù Section A: Action Plan- [ ] Problem statement & provocation (1 paragraph)- [ ] Cite 1‚Äì2 key papers / prior art- [ ] Define audience, assumptions, constraints- [ ] Define 3‚Äì5 falsifiable hypotheses with success criteria + data sources### üêû Core Challenge
Clearly articulate the problem you are addressing. Frame it from a human-centered perspective.
What pain point, inefficiency, or unmet need exists?
Where possible, connect this to a real-world observation from your professional or personal experience to add authenticity.
### ‚ùì ‚ÄúWhat-if?‚Äù
**Industry:** What issue are you trying to address? Why is it an issue? How does it interact with norms/competitors?
**Prototyping:** What is the core "what-if" question? Which assumption are you challenging?
**Research:** What academic theory or design framework informs your approach? Cite 1‚Äì2 key works.
### üéØ Hypotheses ‚Üí Criteria (contract for C.1)
Each hypothesis ‚Üí 1 criterion with OWNER + DATA SOURCE. Every criterion must appear in C.1.

## R ‚Äî Research & Realization
### üìù Section R: Action Plan- [ ] Methods + key findings- [ ] System design + notable technical challenge- [ ] Iterations + ‚â•1 **killed** decision gateR.1 Methods & Findings ‚Äî Describe methods and why chosen; sample; analysis path ‚Üí **3‚Äì5** actionable insights.R.2 System Design & Implementation ‚Äî Hardest technical problem ‚Üí alternatives considered ‚Üí final rationale.R.3 Iterations & Decision Gates ‚Äî Show evolution (low-fi ‚Üí high-fi). For each major decision, cite evidence. Include ‚â•1 **‚Äúwe killed X because Y‚Äù** gate.

## C ‚Äî Characterization, Critique, & Continuation
### üìù Section C: Action Plan- [ ] Fill **C.1** (map rows to **A.4**)- [ ] Complete **C.2** validity checklist (specific, honest)- [ ] Define **C.3** plan (owners, dates, triggers, **kill-criteria**)### ‚ìò Characterization Tables
Choose the correct table for your mode. Delete the other.### Standard / Lite (Quant/Hybrid)

| Criterion (A.4) | Target | Observed | N / CI or SE | Baseline/Control | Ablation / Note | Data Source | **Status** |

> **Status:** `Supported | Mixed | Not Supported | Emergent` ‚Ä¢ Report **IRR** (Œ∫/Œ±) and indicate **saturation** point if used.
**Observed behavior summary** ‚Äî one paragraph tying results back to **A.4**.### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critique (Limits & Validity)
Internal ‚Ä¢ External ‚Ä¢ Construct ‚Ä¢ Statistical validity; Reliability; Instrumentation/Drift; Failure modes;
Bias/Ethics/Accessibility. Include concrete evidence, not buzzwords.
**C.3 Continuation (Decision & Plan)**
- **Decision:** **GO / PIVOT / PAUSE**
- **Plan:** 2‚Äì5 actions with **owners & dates**
- **Triggers:** thresholds to proceed
- **Kill-criteria:** explicit stop rules
- **Risks & mitigations:** top 1‚Äì2
- **Ethics/Compliance:** (e.g., GDPR; consent archived)
